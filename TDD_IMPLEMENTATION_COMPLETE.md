## 🔄 **TDD Workflow Integration**

```bash
# Complete TDD development cycle
make tdd-cycle          # RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR

# Individual phases
make red                # Write failing tests
make green             # Implement to make tests pass
make refactor          # Optimize while keeping tests green

# Quality validation
make coverage          # 95% coverage requirement
make mutation          # 80% mutation score requirement
make performance       # Performance benchmark validation
make validate          # Complete TDD quality gates

# Release readiness
make release-ready     # 100% coverage + 100% pass rate validation
```
