- **Created**: `.github/workflows/tdd-quality-gates.yml` - Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **Quality**: 95% coverage + 80% mutation score + 100% pass rate enforcement

### 3. **Phase 1 TDD Foundation**
- **File**: `helios-core/tests/tdd_phase1_foundation.rs` - Production-ready TDD examples
- **Patterns**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles for all roadmap features
- **Property Testing**: Comprehensive edge case coverage with proptest
- **Performance TDD**: Benchmarks enforcing your 3ms rendering requirements

### 4. **Automated Testing Pipeline**
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow with cross-browser testing
- **Coverage**: Automated 95% threshold enforcement
- **Mutation**: Test quality validation with 80% survival rate
- **Performance**: Regression prevention with benchmark validation

### 5. **TDD Development Tools**
- **Validator**: `scripts/tdd-validator.py` - Quality gate enforcement
- **Configuration**: `tdd-config.toml` - Centralized TDD settings
- **Makefile**: Enhanced with TDD workflow commands (`make tdd-cycle`, `make coverage`, etc.)

## 🔄 **TDD Workflow Integration**

```bash
# Complete TDD development cycle
make tdd-cycle          # RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR

# Individual phases
make red                # Write failing tests
make green             # Implement to make tests pass
make refactor          # Optimize while keeping tests green

# Quality validation
make coverage          # 95% coverage requirement
make mutation          # 80% mutation score requirement
make performance       # Performance benchmark validation
make validate          # Complete TDD quality gates

# Release readiness
make release-ready     # 100% coverage + 100% pass rate validation
```
