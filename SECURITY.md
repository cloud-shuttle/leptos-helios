## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Helios, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing our security team at:

**Email**: [security@cloudshuttle.com](mailto:security@cloudshuttle.com)

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: The potential impact of the vulnerability
4. **Affected Versions**: Which versions of Helios are affected
5. **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal proof of concept
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 72 hours
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We will work with you to resolve the issue
5. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on public disclosure

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (for critical vulnerabilities)
- **Public Disclosure**: Within 90 days (coordinated with reporter)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version of Helios
2. **Review Dependencies**: Regularly update your project dependencies
3. **Validate Input**: Always validate and sanitize user input
4. **Use HTTPS**: Serve your applications over HTTPS in production
5. **Content Security Policy**: Implement appropriate CSP headers
6. **Regular Audits**: Run security audits on your dependencies

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs and outputs
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without information leakage
4. **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies updated and audit regularly
5. **Code Review**: All code changes should be reviewed for security issues
6. **Testing**: Include security testing in your development process

## Security Considerations

### WebGPU Security

Helios uses WebGPU for high-performance rendering. Security considerations include:

- **GPU Memory Access**: WebGPU provides direct GPU memory access
- **Shader Validation**: All shaders are validated before execution
- **Resource Limits**: GPU resources are limited to prevent abuse
- **Sandboxing**: WebGPU runs in a sandboxed environment

### WASM Security

Helios compiles to WebAssembly (WASM) for web deployment:

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's memory safety prevents common vulnerabilities
- **Bounds Checking**: Array and buffer access is bounds-checked
- **Stack Protection**: Stack overflow protection is enabled
- **Control Flow Integrity**: CFI is enabled to prevent ROP attacks

### Data Processing Security

Helios processes data using Polars and DataFusion:

- **SQL Injection**: All SQL queries are parameterized
- **Data Validation**: Input data is validated before processing
- **Memory Limits**: Processing is limited to prevent DoS attacks
- **Access Control**: Data access is controlled and audited

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

### 1. Discovery and Reporting

- Security researchers discover vulnerabilities
- Vulnerabilities are reported through our security email
- We acknowledge receipt and begin investigation

### 2. Assessment and Triage

- We assess the severity and impact of the vulnerability
- We determine affected versions and components
- We assign a severity level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### 3. Fix Development

- We develop a fix for the vulnerability
- We test the fix thoroughly
- We prepare a security advisory

### 4. Coordinated Disclosure

- We coordinate with the reporter on disclosure timing
- We release the fix and security advisory
- We update our security documentation

### 5. Post-Release

- We monitor for any issues with the fix
- We update our security processes if needed
- We recognize the reporter (if desired)

## Severity Levels

### Critical
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation
- Data breach or exposure
- Authentication bypass

### High
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

### Medium
- Local privilege escalation
- Information leakage
- Input validation issues
- Performance degradation

### Low
- Minor information disclosure
- Cosmetic issues
- Best practice violations
- Documentation issues

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are published for vulnerabilities that meet our severity criteria:

- **Critical and High**: Always published
- **Medium**: Published if they affect many users
- **Low**: Published if they have significant impact

Advisories include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Affected versions
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment
- Mitigation steps
- Fix information

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private Reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately first
2. **Coordinated Disclosure**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timing
3. **Adequate Time**: We provide adequate time for fixes to be developed and deployed
4. **Credit**: We give credit to security researchers who report vulnerabilities
5. **No Retaliation**: We do not take legal action against good-faith security research

## Security Research

We encourage security research on Helios:

- **Scope**: Research on Helios and its dependencies
- **Methods**: Use of automated tools, manual testing, and code review
- **Reporting**: Report findings through our security email
- **Recognition**: We recognize security researchers in our advisories

### Out of Scope

The following are out of scope for security research:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Attacks on third-party services
- Denial of service attacks that don't demonstrate a vulnerability
- Issues that require physical access to the target system

## Security Tools and Resources

### Static Analysis

We use several static analysis tools:

- **Clippy**: Rust linter for common issues
- **cargo-audit**: Security audit of dependencies
- **cargo-deny**: License and security policy enforcement
- **semgrep**: Security-focused static analysis

### Dynamic Analysis

We perform dynamic analysis:

- **Fuzzing**: Automated fuzzing of input processing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning of dependencies
- **Container Scanning**: Security scanning of Docker images

### Security Resources
