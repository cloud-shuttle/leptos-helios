# ⚠️ AI-Generated Codebase Disclaimer

## Important Notice

**This entire Helios codebase has been generated using AI-assisted development tools.** This project serves as a proof-of-concept for AI-assisted software development methodologies and should be used with appropriate caution.

## What This Means

### ✅ **What's Included**
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: 28+ tests across all modules using TDD methodology
- **Performance Benchmarks**: 3ms/100K points baseline established and validated
- **Modern Rust Practices**: Follows Rust best practices and idiomatic patterns
- **Complete Documentation**: Extensive documentation and examples
- **Production-Ready Structure**: Proper project organization and build system

### ⚠️ **Important Considerations**
- **Generated Code**: All implementations created via AI assistance
- **Experimental Nature**: This is a proof-of-concept, not a production-tested library
- **Limited Real-World Testing**: While tests pass, real-world usage scenarios may reveal issues
- **AI Limitations**: Generated code may not handle all edge cases or optimizations a human developer would consider

## Usage Recommendations

### For Learning and Experimentation
- ✅ **Excellent for**: Understanding Rust visualization concepts
- ✅ **Great for**: Learning TDD methodologies and test-driven development
- ✅ **Perfect for**: Exploring WebGPU and WASM optimization techniques

### For Production Use
- ⚠️ **Requires**: Thorough testing in your specific use case
- ⚠️ **Needs**: Performance validation for your data sizes and requirements
- ⚠️ **Consider**: Code review and potential refactoring for production requirements
- ⚠️ **Important**: This is experimental software - use at your own risk

## Development Methodology

This project was developed using:
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
- **AI-Assisted Implementation**: All code generated with AI assistance
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Property-based testing and edge case coverage
- **Performance Validation**: Benchmark-driven development
